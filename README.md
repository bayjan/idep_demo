# Reproducing some parts of the results using code instead of GUI

Here we will try to reproduce PCA results obtained using iDEP tool with the demo data.

Some code have been directly copied from R tab (the last tab) in the tool's web-site at: http://bioinformatics.sdstate.edu/idep/

and also its GitHub repo here at:https://github.com/iDEP-SDSU/idep/tree/master/shinyapps/idep 

Sometimes Jupyter Notebooks are not opened in the first try, which could be due to different reasons, but probably due to **GitHub** and not because of **Google Colab**. So, try several times until a notebook is rendered/opened.
